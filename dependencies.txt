This file contains the dependency graph of the formal model of opcua-jinja.pv.
Indeed, the novel proof methodology for ProVerif, presented in Section 4.3.2,
requires, for the proof of a formal property to be sound, all its dependencies
to be also proven.

The dependencies are shown as trees: a given node is proven only when all the sub-nodes from descendants (including the target node itself) have been proven as queries.
